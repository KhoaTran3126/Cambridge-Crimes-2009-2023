<h1>An Analysis of Crimes in Cambridge City: 2009 - 2023</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
The following analysis focuses on crime activities solely in Cambridge City, with the <a href="https://data.cambridgema.gov/Public-Safety/Crime-Reports/xuad-73uj/about_data">raw dataset</a> having been provided by the Cambridge Police Department. Crime activities range from the early 1900s to 2024, comprising over 40 various kinds of crimes in Cambridge City. The information provided by the dataset include the date and time of the committed crime, the affected neighborhood, and other. Being more intrigued by the trends of crime activities and the neighborhoods, this analysis focuses on addressing the following questions:<br></br>

<ol>
  <li>What crimes are popular, rising, and dominating in Cambridge City?</li>
  <li>When are the typial hours which crimes are active?</li>
  <li>What neighborhoods are affected the most by crimes?</li>
  <li>What preventative measures may be taken to control the dominant crimes?</li>
</ol>


<h2>Data Processing</h2>
Although the data ranges from the early 1900s to 2024 for the years which various crimes are enacted, few data points exist prior 2009 (decreases reliability of data) and the data for 2024 is incomplete (forming conclusions through incomplete data could be fatal): I decided to limit my focus on the range 2009-2023 for most analysis because of those reasons.
